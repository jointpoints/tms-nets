/**
 * @namespace tms::analysis
 * 
 * @brief Contains functions for digital nets analyses, like figures of merit and various statistics.
 * 
 * The precision of Quasi Monte Carlo calculations is directly related to the discrepancy of the
 * digital net (e.g., search for "Koksmaâ€“Hlawka inequality"). Discrepancy itself is computationally
 * hard to be calculated directly which makes researchers introduce different metrics conventionally
 * called <b>figures of merit</b> that help one estimate the true discrepancy.
 * 
 * Statistics features that are also introduced here might be useful to verify some basic
 * properties that any "good" digital net should obtain.

	 * Calculates the scatter defect
	 * 
	 * Performs a special version of model-based principal component analysis that was specially
	 * optimised for digital \f$(t, m, s)\f$-nets. Here, having a singular value decomposition
	 * \f$C = U \Sigma V^*\f$ for a covariance matrix \f$C\f$, a \b scatter is defined as a sum of
	 * squares of all singular values, <b>relative influence</b> of the \f$i\f$-th principal axis
	 * is defined as a ratio of the squared \f$i\f$-th singular value to the scatter, and a
	 * <b>scatter defect</b> of the \f$i\f$-th principal axis is defined as a difference between
	 * its relative influence and the value of \f$s^{-1}\f$.
	 * 
	 * If points of the given digital net saturate the \f$s\f$-dimensional unit cube perfectly
	 * equally in all directions, the scatter defect will be \f$\overrightarrow{0} \in
	 * \mathbb{R}^s\f$. If points are scatterred along the \f$i\f$-th principal axis more than it
	 * is expected under the perfectly equal saturation, then the \f$i\f$-th component of defect
	 * vector will be positive, otherwise, negative.
	 * 
	 * @param   net     A digital net.
	 * 
	 * @returns A \ref tms::Point the \f$i\f$-th component of which equals the scatter defect along
	 * the \f$i\f$-th principal axis.
	 * 
	 * @note Principal axes always form an orthonormal basis in the \f$s\f$-dimensional space,
	 * however, there are <i>no guarantees</i> that they will match with the basis that is used to
	 * express the coordinates of digital net points.
